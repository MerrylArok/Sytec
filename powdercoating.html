            <p> Powder coating is more durable and environmentally-friendly than traditional liquid paint. All of our
                steel and aluminum products can be painted in a variety of colors to a smooth, textured, matte or
                metallic finish, and then silk-screened with custom branding. We also provide custom power painting
                services for your finished products.

                        Our products can be customized with ink-filled engraving to include logos, text and QR codes for
                        personalization, identification and tagging. For products used in harsh environments, this
                        ensures longevity and readability.

                        Silk-screening can be used to further personalize painted products. It is a versatile process
                        for applying color-matched graphics to exact specifications for product branding and labelling.

                        We offer powder coating services for customer supplied products. Parts are thoroughly cleaned
                        and rinsed before being coated and cured to the desired finish. They are thoroughly inspected
                        and packed to ensure that they arrive at your facility in excellent condition.
